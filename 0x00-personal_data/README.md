personal data refers to any information that can be used to verify the identity of a user and grant them access to a system or application. This data is crucial for ensuring that only authorized users can log in and access the resources they are permitted to use. Here are the main components of personal data in the context of authentication:

Types of Personal Data in Authentication
Identifiers:

Username: A unique identifier chosen by the user or assigned by the system.
Email Address: Often used as a username or for account recovery and notifications.
Phone Number: Used for two-factor authentication (2FA) and account recovery.
Credentials:

Password: A secret string of characters known only to the user and the system (stored securely as a hash).
Security Questions and Answers: Predefined questions with answers known only to the user, used for account recovery.
Biometric Data: Fingerprints, facial recognition, or other biometric information used for authentication.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Data:

OTP (One-Time Password): A temporary code sent to the user’s phone or email.
Authentication Apps: Codes generated by apps like Google Authenticator or Authy.
Hardware Tokens: Physical devices that generate or display authentication codes.
Session and Token Data:

Session ID: A unique identifier for the user’s session, stored in cookies or local storage.
JWT (JSON Web Token): A token that securely transmits information between parties, often used in stateless authentication.
Refresh Tokens: Tokens used to obtain new access tokens without re-authenticating the user.
Recovery Data:

Backup Codes: One-time use codes provided to the user for account recovery.
Recovery Email or Phone Number: Secondary contact information for recovering access to the account.
Logging and Auditing Data:

Login History: Records of login attempts, including timestamps, IP addresses, and device information.
Audit Trails: Logs of changes made to authentication data or account settings.    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
